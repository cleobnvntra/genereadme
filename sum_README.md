# Simple Arithmetic Functions
====================================================

## Description

This repository contains a simple JavaScript file that provides an arithmetic function to perform addition of two numbers.

## Overview of the sum Function

The `sum` function takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their sum.

### Code Snippet: sum Function

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how the `sum` function works. It takes two arguments, adds them together using the `+` operator, and returns the result.

### Usage Example

To use the `sum` function, simply call it with two numbers as arguments. For example:

```javascript
const result = sum(2, 3);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 5
```
